          Amit offers intensive study and revision of Science concepts online, targeted at students in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme, IB programme and other Science subjects.
          Our courses match the teaching that students receive in their respective schools and make sure that students have a better chance of integrating knowledge, finding the power that helps them to do better in the exams, and help them fill any knowledge gaps they may have. Our goal is always to give students both a comprehensive overview of the entire core syllabus of a subject, and allow them to practice the skills that will help them excel in the different types of examination.

        <p>
         As the tutor provides regular feedback on each unit completed the child gets encouraged to keep learning on their own schedules. The online tutoring at Amit helps build confidence beyond Science proficiency. Using a system focused on concept mastery we teach students how to study, learn and think critically in one place. Our online curriculum teaches Science problems, which help with critical thinking, analytical processes, problem-solving and reasoning skills. This problem solving skills help the students in solving other life problems as well not to give till they solve them.

         We shape lifelong learners by attaching problems to real-life situations which allows our students to get massively better at developing thinking abilities and problem solving skills. Our tutor gives customized classes based on the studentsâ€™ requirements and hence they feel comfortable learning online rather than in a class full of pupil who may distract or demoralize them.
